# coroutines
This repository represents an example of using kotlin coroutines in the Android project.

In this app coroutines were used for network, I/O and extensive operations.

Example project uses https://openweathermap.org/ for fetching weather forecast for the city in which the user's phone is located.

**Note**: To be able to fetch weather forecast in the app, you have to sign up for the api key and replace **YOUR_OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY** in the **app/build.gradle** with your api key.
